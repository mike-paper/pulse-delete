# Open source SaaS metrics

- **Transparency** - Easily drill down and see how metrics are calculated at the customer level
- **Open source** - The entire core is open source and easy to self host
- **Extensible &** **Hackable** - Have some weird edge case you need to exclude? Easily update your data model with a little SQL.
- **Push first** - Metrics can be pushed to Slack, Sheets, and email so you don't need to check yet another dashboard
